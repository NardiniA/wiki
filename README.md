# Wiki - Project 1

 This project utilises django to create a wiki system. This system stores markdown files in a directory which are then retrieved, converted to HTML and displayed to the user.

 The Search system used is a case insensitive search and queries the markdown files and searches against a given query. If a query matches a title it immediately redirects to the entry.

 The random function picks a title from the directory and displays this title to the user. 

 All titles are able to be rewritten and edited. There is no login system so you do not need to be logged in to edit entries. You can also create a new entry by using the form provided and then when submitted a new entry will be saved and able to be displayed to the user.
